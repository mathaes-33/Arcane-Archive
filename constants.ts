      textContent: `PREFACE

This study of English witchcraft is an attempt to deal with the subject from the point of view of the historian of English thought and of English institutions. The professional student of English law and politics may find much in it which he considers as already well known; the specialist in folk-lore will discover what must seem to him an almost inexcusable neglect of his particular field. To the first I can only say that my book is not intended primarily for him; to the second I may plead that a distinct line has to be drawn between the history of witchcraft and the study of the magic arts. This is an historical study of the beliefs in witchcraft as held by the English people, and of the narration of the events which resulted from those beliefs.

It is a field that has been nearly deserted. The late Professor James Bradley Thayer, in his chapters on the jury and its development, touched upon the relation of witchcraft trials to the evolution of the rules of evidence, and that is nearly all that has been done from the standpoint of the historical student. Mr. F. W. Maitland has been over nearly all the original sources for the history of English law, but seems never to have examined the papers of the witchcraft trials. It would have been interesting to see what that master of English legal antiquities would have made out of a subject so filled with suggestion.

Witchcraft had its own literature. Not only were there formal treatises upon the subject, but there was a continuous output from the English press of pamphlets detailing the stories of the trials. It is upon these pamphlets, together with the assize records and the various classes of state papers, that this study has been based.`
